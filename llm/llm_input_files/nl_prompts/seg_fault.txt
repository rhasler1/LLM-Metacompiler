The code you generated successfully compiled but resulted in a segmentation fault during execution. 

1. Common causes of segmentation faults include misaligned memory accesses, out-of-bounds array operations, or null pointer dereferences. Analyze your vectorized code and address any potential issues.
2. Fix the segmentation fault while ensuring the vectorized logic remains functionally identical to the original code. Do not alter the intent of the original algorithm.
3. Ensure all memory accesses are correctly aligned for 32-byte boundaries to avoid segmentation faults.
4. Adhere to the original instructions provided.
5. Only output the corrected code.

Please modify the code accordingly.
