The checksum generated by the vectorized code does not match the baseline. 

1. The mismatch may be due to missed dependencies, incorrect assumptions about data alignment, or improper handling of edge cases. Analyze the vectorized code carefully to identify and fix any such issues.
2. Ensure the corrected vectorized code is functionally identical to the baseline and adheres to all dependencies outlined in the original comments.
3. Adhere to the original instructions provided.
4. Only output the corrected code.

Please modify the code accordingly.
