Instructions:
Vectorize the provided code for an AVX2 target.
The real_t data type is a float (4 bytes).
64 byte array allignment is used.
Target 256-bit wide registers.
Only modify the benchmark function with return type real_t (e.g., real_t s000(...)).
There are comments within the benchmark function describing depences within the function;
use these to help with vectorization.
Retain the unmodified source code in your output, do not add comments.
Only output code, do not provide natural language explanation of output.
