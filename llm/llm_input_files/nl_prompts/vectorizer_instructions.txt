Instructions:
Vectorize the provided code for an AVX2 target.
Use 64 byte array allignment.
Target 256-bit wide registers.
The real_t data type in the code is a float (4 bytes).
Only use functions supported by the following compiler flags: -O3 -mavx2.
For example, -mfma is NOT included, thus fma instructions should not be used.
Only modify the benchmark function with return type real_t (e.g., real_t s000(...)).
There are comments within the benchmark function describing dependencies within the function;
use these to help with vectorization.
Retain the unmodified source code in your output, do not add comments.
Only output code, do not provide natural language explanation of output.
